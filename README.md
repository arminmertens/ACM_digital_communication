Since the data we used in our analysis contains private information of twitter users, we are not able to share it in this repository. Nevertheless, the tweets that were scraped during the national elections in Germany (2017) by GESIS and the tweet IDs can be downloaded using the following link: https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?no=6926). Hence, our analysis can be replicated when scraping the tweets using our provided scripts and running our analysis scripts afterwards.
